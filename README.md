Luhn's algorithm, also known as the "modulus 10" or "mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate various identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers (for mobile phones), and national identification numbers.

The algorithm was developed by a computer scientist named Hans Peter Luhn in 1954. It provides a quick way to check the integrity of a number and detect accidental errors in input. It does not, however, guarantee that the number is valid or that it exists in a database.

The Luhn algorithm works as follows:

Starting from the rightmost digit (the check digit), double the value of every second digit (i.e., digits at even positions) in the number. If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, subtract 9 from that digit.
Add up all the digits in the modified number, including the untouched digits.
If the total sum is divisible by 10 (i.e., the modulus 10 of the sum is 0), then the number is considered valid according to Luhn's algorithm.
